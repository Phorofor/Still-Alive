Still Alive
===========

So I was bored and made this.

Of course you need to have the mp3 or whatever yourself.

Requirements
------------

* Ruby
* tput (standard on Linux and Mac OS X. You need
Cygwin for that on Windows)

Usage
-----

Type `./still.rb`, then start the song when the countdown hits 0. Easy peasy.
